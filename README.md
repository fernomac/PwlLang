# PwlLang

A little language extension based on [mbeddr](https://mbeddr.com) for [Papers We Love @ Seattle](https://github.com/papers-we-love/seattle).

It adds an `unless` statement type:

```c
do {
  // Some stuff.
} unless (aReasonNotToDoIt);
```
And the sandbox has some examples of using it together with other mbeddr modules.
